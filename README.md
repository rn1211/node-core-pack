# pmm

> A package manager manager - going full circle ðŸ™‚

*Note: the `pmm` name (and other names) are temporary placeholders. This document is mostly aims to address the design of the feature.*

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn build` (no need for `yarn install`)
3. The `dist/` directory now contains the pmm build and the shims
4. Call `node ./dist/pmm --version` and behold

You can also run the tests with `yarn jest` (still no install needed).

## What problem does it solve?

Various problems arise from npm being the only package manager shipped by default:

- Projects using popular package management solutions other than npm (particularly Yarn and pnpm) require additional installation step that must often be repeated when switching between Node versions. This lead to a significant part of the Node userbase effectively being a second-class citizen, which sounds unfortunate.

- Because one package manager currently holds a special treatment, users are more likely to pick it even if they would choose another solution should they have the choice (it really depends on how they balance the tradeoffs, but sometimes they value simplicity over purely technical factors). This artificial barrier hurts our community by making it harder to pick the right tool for the job.

- Having a single official package manager means that all the keys belong to a single player which can do whatever it pleases with it (even the Node project only has a limited influence over it, since removing the unique package manager would be poorly accepted by the community). Spreading these responsibilities over multiple projects gives less power to each, ensuring that everyone behave well.

## Envisioned workflow

1. Users would install `node` as usual.

2. Node would be distributed slightly differently:

  - Pmm would be included by Node out of the box.

  - Npm wouldn't be included out of the box anymore

  - However, the Node distribution would include jump binaries that would simply delegate to `pmm <package manager name>`. Pmm would then handle the install logic.

  - Pmm could potentially be distributed as a Node subcommand rather than a standalone binary. In this case, commands in this document such as `pmm install <name@version>` would be replaced by `node --pmm install <name@version>` (or any other variant).

3. Regular users would keep using the `yarn` / `npm` / `pnpm` global binaries same as now, except that they would be lazily downloaded, without having to be manually installed (because included in the node distribution).

4. Project authors would most of the time only have to care about the binaries as well, but they would be able to upgrade package manager versions simply by changing the versions set in the `engines.pm` field.

  - Pmm could reasonably provide some kind of basic interface to select it from the command line (similar to what `emsdk` does for the [emscripten toolchain](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk#how-do-i-check-for-updates-to-the-emscripten-sdk), or what [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) does for Node releases).

5. Docker users would follow a similar workflow; the default image would run network queries to install the right package manager for the project being installed.

  - Users with strong offline requirements would be able to run the `pmm install <name@version>` command when preparing the image, which would ensure that the specific package manager is made available for later use.

  - Further network access could be disabled entirely by setting `PMM_ENABLE_NETWORK=0` in the environmen - Pmm would then only use the package managers that got installed by prior `pmm insall` calls.

6. Package manager maintainers would submit a PR to the Node repository each time they wish for a new version to be made available through pmm. Merging the PR would instantly make the new version available to Node users.

## How does it work?

When any of the embed binaries are called, the tool will find the closest ancestor `package.json` for the current directory. It will then extract the `engines.pm` key, configured as such:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "pm": "yarn@^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

The tool will then check whether it got called via the right binary endpoint (`npm` or `npx` when the package manager is configured for npm, `yarn` when configured for Yarn, etc), and will report an error otherwise. This ensures that we can't accidentally call, say, pnpm on an npm project (which would otherwise lead to diverging environments since the lockfiles and features wouldn't be the same depending on the interpreting package managers).

If the check succeeded, the tool will check whether a compatible package manager has been installed (they're all stored on the disk in the local user's home folder). If not, it will install the latest matching release (based on the information dynamically retrieved from [`versions.json`](/versions.json)). Once it has ensured that a version exists, it'll forward the call to it.

## Frequently asked questions

**Why not just ask the user which package manager they want to use when installing Node?**

Whether to use npm or Yarn or pnpm isn't up to the user but to each individual project. Different projects leverage different features from different package managers. For example one project might rely on the Yarn workspaces, whereas another has setup their repository with pnpm in mind.

**How would things work with global packages?**

Nothing would change in the context of this particular proposal. Npm would keep installing its globals alongside Node, and Yarn would keep installing them into the user's home directory.

**Why not just keep only npm?**

While npm is favored by the majority of the ecosystem, a significant portion decided to use different tools. Their use cases deserve to be heard rather than be discarded simply because a slightly higher percentage of users happens not to directly benefit from it. Additionally, keeping powers balanced is important - even more so given that npm is a corporate entity with little oversight.

From the npm perspective, a project such as Pmm would also have its benefits: projects regularly break when upgrading from one Node version to another because of npm being upgraded as well. By pinning the package manager version, they would ensure that their users only upgrade when they are ready to, decreasing accidental frustration.

## Known issues

- The `pnpx` and `npx` binaries can only be called from within pnpm and npm projects, respectively. This is because otherwise we cannot infer the package manager version from the local manifest, as it would list another package manager instead. Fixing that is possible if we include "global installs" features inside pmm (so that we would fallback to the global `npx` in those circumstances). It seemed out of scope for the initial prototype, but we certainly can discuss it in an issue.
