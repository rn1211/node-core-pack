# pmm

> A package manager manager - going full circle ðŸ™‚

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn build` (no need for `yarn install`)
3. The `dist/` directory now contains the pmm build and the shims
4. Call `node ./dist/pmm --version` and behold

You can also run the tests with `yarn jest` (still no install needed).

## What problem does it solve?

Various problems arise from npm being the only package manager shipped by default:

- Projects using popular package management solutions other than npm (particularly Yarn and pnpm) require additional installation step that must often be repeated when switching between Node versions. This lead to a significant part of the Node userbase effectively being a second-class citizen, which sounds unfortunate.

- Because one package manager currently holds a special treatment, users are more likely to pick it even if they would choose another solution should they have the choice (it really depends on how they balance the tradeoffs, but sometimes they value simplicity over purely technical factors). This artificial barrier hurts our community by making it harder to pick the right tool for the job.

- Having a single official package manager means that all the keys belong to a single player which can do whatever it pleases with it (even the Node project only has a limited influence over it, since removing the unique package manager would be poorly accepted by the community). Spreading these responsibilities over multiple projects gives less power to each, ensuring that everyone behave well.

## How does it work?

When any of the embed binaries are called, the tool will find the closest ancestor `package.json` for the current directory. It will then extract the `engines.pm` key, configured as such:

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "pm": "yarn@^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

The tool will then check whether it got called via the right binary endpoint (`npm` or `npx` when the package manager is configured for npm, `yarn` when configured for Yarn, etc), and will report an error otherwise. This ensures that we can't accidentally call, say, pnpm on an npm project (which would otherwise lead to diverging environments since the lockfiles and features wouldn't be the same depending on the interpreting package managers).

If the check succeeded, the tool will check whether a compatible package manager has been installed (they're all stored on the disk in the local user's home folder). If not, it will install the latest matching release (based on the information dynamically retrieved from [`versions.json`](/versions.json)). Once it has ensured that a version exists, it'll forward the call to it.

> Whether to use npm or Yarn or pnpm isn't up to the user but to each individual project. Different projects leverage different features from different package managers. For example one project might rely on the Yarn workspaces, whereas another has setup their repository with pnpm in mind.

## Known issues

- The `pnpx` and `npx` binaries can only be called from within pnpm and npm projects, respectively. This is because otherwise we cannot infer the package manager version from the local manifest, as it would list another package manager instead. Fixing that is possible if we include "global installs" features inside pmm (so that we would fallback to the global `npx` in those circumstances). It seemed out of scope for the initial prototype, but we certainly can discuss it in an issue.
